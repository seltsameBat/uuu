                            16!! even though I know you’re not a huge fan of all the birthday hype, today is still your day.<br><br>
                            Life’s a total rollercoaster, isn’t it? Some days you’re like, “WOOO, I’m killing it!” and other days, you're just trying to make it through without losing your mind. But hey, it’s all part of the ride. The bad days? They don’t last. The good days? Well, they don’t last either, so enjoy them when you have them. It’s all part of this crazy thing called life. and you’ve got the strength to handle it all. Just keep moving forward like you're chasing the bad guys, minus the faceplants.<br><br>
                            Listen, I’m proud of you. like, ridiculously proud. You’re 16, and I don’t know how you did it, but you’ve already made such a big difference in so many lives, including mine. You’re kind, smart, and you make life better just by being you. You make people feel seen, you make them feel better, and you make us laugh (even when you don’t try). The world needs more people like Seriously, no exaggeration. You’re a legend in the making.<br><br>
                            Balance is everything. You don’t need to go from zero to hero in one day. Take it slow when you need to, but chase what makes you happy. Life’s about finding your rhythm. I know you’re doing your best, and that’s all you need to do. You’ve got this. I’ve seen you handle things like a pro. Keep doing you.<br><br>
                             Here’s to another year of you being amazing. Go have the best day ever, whether it’s chill or totally wild.<br><br>
                            With all my respect & hopeful energy,

                            Hi,<br><br>
                            Happy Birthday. I’ve been thinking a lot about what to say, and I keep starting over because none of it feels quite right. But I think that’s because sometimes birthdays feel complicated. Sometimes they’re happy, and sometimes they’re just another day. I don’t know if you feel that way, but if you do, I get it. Either way, I’m glad today exists because it means you’re here. And I’m glad you’re here.<br><br>
                            I was thinking about all the days that led up to this one, and how lucky I feel to have spent some of them with you. I don’t always say how much that means to me, but it does. You’re a good person. Even on the quiet days when not much happens. Even on the hard days when you don’t feel like yourself. I notice those things, and I notice you. I just thought you should know that.<br><br>
                            Sometimes it feels like the world keeps moving, and you’re just stuck, watching it all happen without you. I don’t know if you ever feel that way, but I do. It’s hard, and it’s lonely, and sometimes it feels like no one notices. I don’t have the perfect words to make that go away, and I won’t pretend that I do. But maybe feeling lost isn’t something you fix with words. Maybe it’s just about having someone with you while you figure it out. If that’s true, then I’ll be here. No matter how long it takes. I won’t try to fix you or push you to feel better. I’ll just be here, until it’s over.<br><br>
                            I think people like us feel things a little deeper, and maybe that’s why we get lost more easily. But I also think that’s why we notice things others don’t. Like the way the light looks in the evening, or how a song can make you feel safe, even if just for a moment. I think that’s special, and I think you’re special too. Even if you don’t always feel that way.<br><br>
                            Happy Birthday. I hope today is gentle with you. I hope you feel seen. And I hope you know that, even when you feel lost, you’re not invisible.<br><br>
                            always,<br><br>

                            You know, I’ve learned that sometimes the best days are the ones when you don’t try too hard. Just let things happen, and enjoy the little moments along the way. Life’s better that way. Keep it simple.<br><br>

                            Hey,<br><br>
                            Let’s skip the part where I pretend to be good at heartfelt letters. (Last time I tried, I webbed the card to a pigeon. Long story.) But you? You’re the kind of person who makes hero work feel worth it. Not because you’ve got powers, hell, you don’t need ’em. But because you’ve got that stubborn light in you that refuses to quit. On people. On dreams. On fixing what’s broken<br><br>
                            Here’s the Spidey secret no one talks about, 90% of this job is just… doing it. Yeah, I know, discipline sounds like a fancy word for “suffering through stuff in disguise.” But that’s where the magic hides. Suiting up when I’d rather nap. Fixing my busted web-shooters again. Patrolling in the rain because “eh, someone’s gotta.” Sounds boring? Maybe. But boring’s what builds the days you’ll brag about later. You already know that, though. You’ve got your own version; showing up, grinding, being the person your people lean on. That’s not luck. That’s you. And it’s way harder than dodging Goblin gliders.<br><br>
                            Happy Birthday, haya. Here’s your mission, should you choose to accept it; Do something today that’d make Past You proud. Even if it’s just ignoring your texts for 12 hours straight. Maybe it’s rewatching that movie you love but pretend you don’t. Or hell, maybe it’s just existing unapologetically, no explanations, no guilt, just you. And if anyone tries to harsh your vibe? Annoy them so creatively they’ll suspect you’ve been taking lessons from a certain web-head. (Spoiler: You don’t need ’em.) <br><br>
                          
                            keep swinging,<br><br>
